## Introduction

In many applications, random number generation is crucial. However, the standard `rand()` function in C often falls short in terms of both security and statistical quality. The **rand-enhanced** library aims to address these issues by providing a robust PRNG that generates 32-bit integers. This makes it suitable for cryptographic applications and other scenarios where high-quality randomness is required.

## Features

- **Fast Performance**: Optimized for speed, making it suitable for real-time applications.
- **Statistical Strength**: Produces high-quality random numbers that meet statistical standards.
- **Security Compliance**: Designed to be secure, making it suitable for sensitive applications.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that allows for easy integration into existing C projects.

## Installation

To get started with **rand-enhanced**, you can download the latest release from our [Releases page](https://github.com/Nishanth-Gowthaman/rand-enhanced/releases). Simply download the appropriate file for your system, and follow the installation instructions provided in the documentation.

## Usage

Using **rand-enhanced** is straightforward. After installation, you can include the header file in your C program:

```c
#include "rand-enhanced.h"
```

You can then initialize the PRNG and generate random numbers as follows:

```c
// Initialize the PRNG
init_rand();

// Generate a random number
uint32_t random_number = rand32();
```

## Examples

Here are a few examples demonstrating how to use the library effectively:

### Basic Example

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "rand-enhanced.h"

int main() {
    init_rand(); // Initialize the PRNG
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        printf("Random Number %d: %u\n", i + 1, rand32());
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Secure Random Number Generation

For applications requiring secure random numbers, ensure you properly seed the PRNG:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <time.h>
#include "rand-enhanced.h"

int main() {
    // Seed with the current time
    seed_rand(time(NULL));
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        printf("Secure Random Number %d: %u\n", i + 1, rand32());
    }
    return 0;
}
```
